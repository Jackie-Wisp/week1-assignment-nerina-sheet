# week1-assignment-nerina-sheet
A website designed as a character sheet for a fictional character I have been writing

I have been having trouble understanding positioning and flexboxes. I find it very hard to visualise the layers and then impliment them in my head all at once. I also don't fully understand how to get all the elements to move with the window size of the page or relative to their parent boxes
