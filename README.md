A website designed as a character sheet for a fictional character I have been writing

I have been having trouble understanding positioning and flexboxes. I find it very hard to visualise the layers and then impliment them in my head all at once. I also don't fully understand how to get all the elements to move with the window size of the page or relative to their parent boxes

Reflection:

I will likely come back to this. Its clear my struggle is still understanding how to intitally understand flexboxes and my rush and excitment to get into this projects has started to show when I realise, ammending a parent div requires ammending the positioning of all its children. I think I understand my main problem was linking the contentbox class and the background img as the same thing, when the background image should of been put into body or atleast seperate. Allowing the content box to have an absolute positioning and then fix up the divs inside. I could be wrong on this and It is something I will be returning to as I learn more and study more. I may attempt to build a similar website and make sure to test the flex of every element I impliment to slowly get more understanding of it. For now, I am happy with how it currently looks, even if the code behind it isn't as serene as it could be. I have the intentions to keep adding to this, growing and changing it to be more streamline.
